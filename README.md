# My Chores Web App

The My Chores web app was developed as my first Spring (*not Spring Boot*) Web Application. It allows users to:

* Create a user, and log in
* Create groups of chore users (a household, for example)
* Schedule and assign chores to users, defining the specific frequency of the chore.
* View a to-do list of their current chores and check them off when completed

The backend is a Java, Spring RESTful API built with Maven, using a MySQL database. The front-end is written with AngularJS.
